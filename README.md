This is a working piece of code that I thought, might be an interesting case study for people who are transitioning from java to scala. Especially if you are someone who has experience implementing command pattern it could be worthwhile comparison. What really impressed me about scala is that it had tried to compress the number of lines you write to solve a problem in a very, what you may call... A zealotic manner.

Take a look at the code and if it helps you in some way, I am happy to help.
